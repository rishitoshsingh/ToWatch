# ToWatch

## Project is Live

[![Get it on Google Play](https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphae.rishi.towatch)

## The basic idea of the application : 
  ToWatch is an application exclusive to movie fans.

If you never want to forget which movies you want to see, when they get released, you should definitely try this app.

Be notified about happenings in the movie industry via push notifications.

Let's say you came across a good trailer for a movie which will be released later and you don't want to miss it at any cost. All you have to do is to share that trailer to ToWatch app and add it to your playlist or towatch list. You can even save to cloud (if you want) so that when you log in again from a new device you will get your movies back.
